The way to express non-transitive dependencies is neverlink, so that the base version was OK and should be adjuested to \"Harmonize names of repositories\" change, e.g.:\n\n  \"@commons-codec//jar:neverlink\",\n  [...]\n\nYou can test final artifact with unzip rammitmq.jar | grep commons\n\nNote that commons-io is one single exceptionand that\u0027s why it is included as transitive dependency. That is the only dependency, we put in core, that is not a part of release.war. The reason we do that is because replication plugin depeds on it.",
